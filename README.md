# SMT-Formula-Rewriting
This project is to design/automatically generate rewriting rules for SMT formulas to conduct satisfiability-preserving rewriting. After the rewriting the solving result should be the same. The rewriting rules can be used to 1) find soundness bugs in SMT solvers, 2) uncover potential performance/incompleteness issues, or 3) improve the performance.
